About FAudio
------------
FAudio was written to be used for FNA's Audio/Media namespaces. We access this
library via FAudio#, which you can find in the 'csharp/' directory.

Dependencies
------------
FAudio depends solely on SDL2. FAudio never explicitly uses the C runtime.

Building FAudio
---------------
For *nix platforms, just type `make` in the root directory!

For Windows, see the 'visualc/' directory.

For Xbox One, see the 'visualc-winrt/' directory.

For iOS/tvOS, see the 'Xcode-iOS/' directory.
