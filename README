This is FAudio, an XAudio reimplementation that focuses solely on developing
fully accurate DirectX Audio runtime libraries for the FNA project, including
XAudio2, X3DAudio, XAPO, and XACT3.

NOTE TO DEVELOPERS
------------------
This project is extremely early in development! Do not use this until it has
been fully integrated into FNA, unless you really like broken software.

License
-------
FAudio is released under the zlib license. See LICENSE for details.

About FAudio
------------
FAudio was written to be used for FNA's Audio/Media namespaces. We access this
library via FAudio#, which you can find in the 'csharp/' directory.

Dependencies
------------
FAudio depends solely on SDL2. FAudio never explicitly uses the C runtime.

Building FAudio
---------------
For *nix platforms, just type `make` in the root directory!

For Windows, see the 'visualc/' directory.

For Xbox One, see the 'visualc-winrt/' directory.
