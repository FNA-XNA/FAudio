---------------------------
FAudio uses Visual Studio 2010 to build on Windows.

TODO: REMOVE C RUNTIME DEPENDENCY!

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download SDL3's VC development libraries from the latest tag:

https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/latest

Extract the ZIP file's SDL3 directory (called something like 'SDL3-3.4.0') as
a sibling to your FAudio checkout and rename it to 'SDL3', so that you have
directories named 'FAudio' and 'SDL3' next to each other.

Compiling
---------
1. Build FAudio.sln
2. Grab the output DLL along with SDL3.dll, ship it!
